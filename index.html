                            CPU (Central Processing Unit) is the main processor in a computer, responsible for executing instructions and performing calculations. It manages tasks by fetching, decoding, and executing data. The CPU is essential for running programs and controlling the flow of operations, working with memory and other components. It is often referred to as the "brain" of the computer, influencing overall system performance.

                        <p>
                            GPU (Graphics Processing Unit) is a processor designed to handle graphics rendering, such as images, videos, and animations. Unlike a CPU, which processes tasks sequentially, a GPU performs many tasks in parallel, making it ideal for tasks like gaming, video editing, and machine learning. It accelerates computationally intense workloads, especially those involving graphics or large datasets.

                                RAM (Random Access Memory) is temporary storage that allows quick access to data the CPU is currently using. It helps speed up processes and multitasking but loses all data once the computer is turned off.

                                SSD (Solid State Drive) is a fast storage device that uses flash memory, with no moving parts. It offers quicker data access, improves system performance, and is more durable than traditional hard drives (HDDs).

                        <p>
                            The motherboard is the main circuit board that connects and allows communication between a computer's components, such as the CPU, RAM, and storage. It also provides power and expansion slots for additional hardware.

                        <p>
                            The power supply converts electricity from an outlet into usable power for the computerâ€™s components, like the CPU, RAM, and storage. It ensures stable operation and comes in various wattages to meet system needs.
